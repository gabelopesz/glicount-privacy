    <h1>Glicount Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> Oct 26, 2025</p> 
    <p>Welcome to Glicount! This Privacy Policy describes how Gabriel Lopes Martins ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you through our mobile application Glicount (the "Application").</p>

    <p>By using the Application, you agree to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the Application. The types of information we collect include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Registration Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name and email address through Firebase Authentication. Your password is securely managed by Firebase Authentication, and we do not have access to it.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> We collect the data you enter to personalize calculations, such as Insulin/Carbohydrate Ratio (I/C), Insulin Sensitivity Factor, and Target Blood Glucose (goal).</li>
                <li><strong>Meal Data:</strong> We collect information about your meals, including type (breakfast, lunch, etc.), date/time, foods consumed, quantities, nutritional information (primarily carbohydrates), and optionally, blood glucose levels before and after meals, and notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Foods:</strong> If you manually add foods, we store the information provided (name, carbohydrates, portion size, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Insulin Calculation Data:</strong> We store the results of insulin dose calculations performed in the application, including total carbohydrates, current blood glucose, and calculated doses.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage and Diagnostic Data:</strong> We may collect information about how you use the Application to help us diagnose problems and improve the experience (potentially using Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics).</li>
                <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We use a secure, device-specific identifier to manage offline sessions (authentication tokens).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Application.</li>
        <li>Authenticate users and protect accounts.</li>
        <li>Perform carbohydrate counting and insulin dose calculations based on the data provided.</li>
        <li>Allow logging and viewing of meal and calculation history.</li>
        <li>Synchronize your data between devices (when online) through Firebase Firestore.</li>
        <li>Improve and personalize the Application.</li>
        <li>Respond to your support requests.</li>
        <li>Monitor and analyze usage trends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> We use Firebase services for authentication, cloud data storage (Firestore), usage analysis (Analytics, if enabled), and crash reporting (Crashlytics, if enabled). Firebase's use of data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> The application uses Google Play Services. The use of data by these services is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights or property, or protect the personal safety of users or the public.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your data (profile, meals, custom foods, calculations) is stored locally on your device in a secure database (SQLite/Drift).</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> When you are online and logged in, your data is synchronized and stored securely in Firebase Firestore, associated with your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> We employ reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. The security of your password is your responsibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

    <p>You have certain rights regarding your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You can access and update your profile information directly within the Application. You can view your meal and calculation history.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete specific meal items, custom foods, or calculations within the application. To delete your account and all associated data, please contact us via the email provided below. Deleting your Firebase Auth account will remove your authentication data. Associated data in Firestore and locally will be removed upon request or app uninstallation (local data).</li>
        <li><strong>Offline Token Management:</strong> The application uses a secure token stored locally to allow offline use for a limited period (up to 30 days). This token is automatically renewed when you use the application online.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
